# Prediciton-of-Google-Stock-Prize
In this project the main motive is to predict the share price of Google stocks. The Problem statement was that we had to use Recurrent Neural Network Algorithm to predict the share price of Google Dataset of 6 features which had total 1258 data points in it was provided which contained data like Date, Open Price, and High Price etc. which was used to train our model and predict when new data is provided. 
In this Project different libraries like Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn are used to work with given data and also to plot various graphs and heat maps. We have also used SKLEARN and Keras Library for using the RNN algorithm to predict the stock prize. Limitations of this project are it would just give an idea about the price, it would not be totally correct because accuracy is not 100%.
